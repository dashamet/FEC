# 2005-2006 Federal Election Commission Filings

This repo contains my analysis of 3 datasets from the 2005-06 Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings: committees, individual contributions, and candidates. In part 1, I answer basic questions about the contents of the candidates dataset. In part 2, I create a table of the 5 parties with the largest cash holdings. In part 3, I create a table of the unique number of committee and candidates IDs in each party. In part 4, I create a table of the financial contributions of Harvard professors to political parties. In part 5, I create a graph using the analysis in part 4. 

The data I used is from the FEC website: https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data
