# 2005-2006 Federal Election Commission Filings

* `fec.rmd` contains my analysis of 3 datasets from the 2005-06 Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings: committees, individual contributions, and candidates. It produces the HTML file `fec.html`.
  * In part 1, I conduct a preliminary exploratory analysis of the candidates dataset. 
  * In part 2, I create a table of the 5 parties with the largest cash holdings. 
  * In part 3, I create a table of the unique number of committee IDs and candidate IDs in each party. 
  * In part 4, I create a table of the financial contributions of Harvard professors to political parties.
  
* `fec_graphic.Rmd` contains code for a visualization of Harvard professors' financial contributions to political parties (see part 4 above). It produces the HTML file `fec_graphic.html`. 

* I used data from the [FEC](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data).
